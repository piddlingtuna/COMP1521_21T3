## Fun Fact

"The Nintendo 64, along with the PlayStation, were among the highest volume users of MIPS architecture processors in the mid-1990s." - Wikipedia

## What is MIPS?

Python - high level

C, C++, etc

Assembly - MIPS, x86, ARM

Machine code - low level

## How to Code in MIPS?

- Have the instruction set open.
- Have the C code open.
    - Except for some challenge exercises, you will always be given the equivalent C code.
    - It might be better to translate the C code into MIPS like C code.
- Include the equivalent C code in comments.
- On top of every function, include a comment with:
    - Frame: registers stored on the stack.
    - Uses: registers where the value is used.
    - Clobbers: registers where the value is changed.

## How to run MIPS?

### SPIM

TODO

**Your code will be tested with SPIM.**

### QtSpim

Todo

### Mipsy

TODO

**If you use Mipsy, make sure you test it with SPIM.**
