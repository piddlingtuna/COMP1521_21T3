# Question 1

What are mipsy, spim, qtspim & xspim?

## Emulators

MIPS can only run on a MIPS CPU. However, MIPS CPUs is not very popular these days... 

All four are MIPS emulators which simulate the execution of a MIPS CPU and let you run MIPS assembler on any computer.

## mipsy

mipsy has been developed at CSE by Zac Kologlu - and it designed to give students learning MIPS assembler extra help.

mipsy is the best emulator to use to develop and debug your assembler programs.

mipsy is very new so if you find bugs - please report in the course forum.

## spim

spim is a similar (much older) program. You probably need to use spim for this weeks second challenge exercise because mipsy might not (yet) work for the unusual things you need to do in it.

## qtspim & xspim

qtspim & xspim are GUI-based versions of spim. They show you the value in all registers and the state of memory which is helpful when debugging. Students usually prefer qtspim

We hope to deploy a web-based version of mipsy in time for you to use this term. It should be better then qtspim & xspim.

**Your code will be tested with SPIM.**
