**Due Week 8 Monday 09:00:00.**

```
There will be a correctness penalty for assignments that do not use the stack to save and restore $ra.

There will be a correctness penalty for assignments that do not follow these important MIPS calling conventions:
- that function arguments shall be passed in registers $a0...$a3;
- that values in registers $s0...$s7 shall be preserved across function calls: if a function changes these registers, it must restore the original value before returning.
- that different functions should not coordinate registers between them.
```

## Covering

- Using RAM in MIPS
- Arrays in MIPS
- Endianness (optional)
- Functions (optional)
    - Will be covered in week07.
    - Very important for assignment from subset 1.

## Memes

Memes are hard to find for this topic.
