Conceptually, the MIPS pseudo-instruction to load an address could be encoded as something like the following:

li $t0, 2 000 000 0000

Since addresses in MIPS are 32-bits long, how can this instruction load an address that references the data area, such as 0x10010020?

## Pseudo Instruction

The la pseudo-instruction is implemented as two real MIPS instructions:

la $t1, address

0x10010020 --> 0x10010000

lui  $t1, BaseAddr      # top 16 bits of address
ori  $t1, $t1, Offset   # bottom 16 bits of address

x10010020 --> 0x00000020

The assembler splits la into two instructions.

lui == load upper immediate loads

ori == bitwise or immediate

How do we load 0x10010020 into a register?

0x10010000 | 0x00000020 = 0x10010020

So use lui to load 0x10010000 and ori to load 0x00000020.

Same technique is used for li (load immediate).

If it has a tick, it is a real instruction.
Otherwise it is a pseudo instruction.
