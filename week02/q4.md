The flags are contained in an 8-bit register, defined as:
unsigned char device;

Write C expressions to implement each of the following:


a. mark the device as locked for reading bytes

device = (READING | AS_BYTES | LOCKED)

0b00000001 |
0b00000100 |
0b00010000 ==
0b00010101

b. mark the device as locked for writing blocks

device = (WRITING |AS_BLOCKS | LOCKED)


c. set the device as locked, leaving other flags unchanged

0b00000101 |
0b00010000 ==
0b00010101

device = device | LOCKED:
device |= LOCKED:


d. remove the lock on a device, leaving other flags unchanged


e. switch a device from reading to writing, leaving other flags unchanged


f. swap a device between reading and writing, leaving other flags unchanged
