Consider a file of size 10000 bytes, open for reading on file descriptor fd, initially positioned at the start of the file (offset 0).

What will be the file position after each of these calls to lseek()?
Assume that they are executed in sequence, and one will change the file state that the next one deals with.

## Reading changes the file offset

read(1000 bytes); file offset -> advance 1000 bytes
read(1000 bytes); file offset -> advance 1000 bytes

## Whence is signed

whence:
 - SEEK_SET - start of file
 - SEEK_CUR - current offset
 - SEEK_END - end of file

a. lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);
// move to the end of the file

b. lseek(fd, -1000, SEEK_CUR);
// go 1000 bytes back from the current position?

c. lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);
// go back to the start


d. lseek(fd, -100, SEEK_SET);
// nothing

g. lseek(fd, 100, SEEK_END);



## Create a really large file

```c
int fd = open("file/path", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC);
char *buffer = "1";
write(fd, buffer, 2);
lseek(fd, 1000000000000, SEEK_END); // The file system doesn't actually allocate this much space.
write(fd, buffer, 2);
close(fd);
```
