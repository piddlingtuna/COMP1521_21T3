What does fopen do? What are its parameters?

**C library function**

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode);
```

`fopen` opens a file and returns FILE* to handle it.
It's a library function that wraps arounds the open system call.

Example:
```c
FILE *stream = fopen("README.md", "a+");
```

**For every fopen, there is an equal and opposite fclose.**

fprintf - takes a FILE*
fscanf - takes a FILE*


## System calls

These are C library functions that wrap over system calls.
fopen -> open
fclose -> close
fprintf -> write
fscanf -> read
FILE* -> int (file descriptor)
