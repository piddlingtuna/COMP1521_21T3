One possible (and quite old) approach to loading programs into memory is to load the entire program address space into a single contiguous chunk of RAM, but not necessarily at location 0. For example:

Doing this requires all of the addresses in the program to be rewritten relative to the new base address.

Consider the following piece of MIPS code, where loop1 is located at 0x1000, end_loop1 is located at 0x1028, and array is located at 0x2000. If the program containing this code is loaded starting at address A = 0x8000, which instructions need to be rewritten, and what addresses are in the relocated code?

```
   li  $t0, 0
   li  $t1, 0
   li  $t2, 20  # elements in array
loop1:
   bge $t1, $t2, end_loop1
   mul $t3, $t1, 4
   la  $t4, array <- changed
   add $t3, $t3, $t4
   lw  $t3, ($t3)
   add $t1, $t1, $t3
   add $t1, $t1, 1
   j   loop1 <- changed
end_loop1:
```

j == go to this absolute address

b == go to this relative address (e.g. go 40 bytes below)

loop1 == 0x1000 + 0x8000 == 0x9000

end_loop1 = 0x1028 + 0x8000 = 0x9028

array == 0x2000 + 0x8000 == 0xA000
