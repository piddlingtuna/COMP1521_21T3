One possible (and quite old) approach to loading programs into memory is to load the entire program address space into a single contiguous chunk of RAM, but not necessarily at location 0. For example:

Doing this requires all of the addresses in the program to be rewritten relative to the new base address.

Consider the following piece of MIPS code, where loop1 is located at 0x1000, end_loop1 is located at 0x1028, and array is located at 0x2000. If the program containing this code is loaded starting at address A = 0x8000, which instructions need to be rewritten, and what addresses are in the relocated code?

```
   li  $t0, 0
   li  $t1, 0
   li  $t2, 20  # elements in array
loop1: // 0x10200
   bge $t1, $t2, end_loop1
   mul $t3, $t1, 4
   la  $t4, array // 0x10420
   add $t3, $t3, $t4
   lw  $t3, ($t3)
   add $t1, $t1, $t3
   add $t1, $t1, 1
   j   loop1
end_loop1: // 0x10220
```

j == go to this absolute address (e.g. go to address 40)

b == go to this relative address (e.g. go 40 bytes below)
